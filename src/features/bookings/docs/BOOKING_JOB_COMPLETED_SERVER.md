# Booking `job_completed` — server notes

Mobile calls `POST …/bookings/{id}/actions` with `{ "action": "job_completed", ... }`. **Mobile is wired** when `MARK_COMPLETE_USE_JOB_COMPLETED_ACTION` is `true`.

**Full contract (handoff gate, payment payload, receipt SMS):** [`BOOKING_JOB_LIFECYCLE_SERVER.md`](./BOOKING_JOB_LIFECYCLE_SERVER.md) §6.

**Shared request/response tables, SMS history, idempotency:** [`MOBILE_SMS_AND_BOOKING_ACTIONS.md`](./MOBILE_SMS_AND_BOOKING_ACTIONS.md) §4.

## Server must

1. Set `job_status = completed` **and** `status = completed`.
2. Run post-completion side effects (maintenance, etc.).
3. Send **one** customer notification: review SMS → email fallback, or plain thank-you if already reviewed.
4. Return `bookingStatus`, `jobStatus`, `sms`, and `email` outcome blocks.

## Mobile must not

- Call `POST …/review-invite` after `job_completed`.
- Use legacy `completeBookingWithReviewInvite` for the same booking when the feature flag is on.
